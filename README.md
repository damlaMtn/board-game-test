# Starloop unity coding test

## Premise:
• We just want to see how your architecture looks, how you communicate the results, and more
than anything how you structure code and unity assets.\
• You have complete freedom in your approach. There is no right/wrong answer.\
• Feel free to use any framework, package, Asset store asset, Map type, whatever.

## Description:
### Build a small board game style game:
● Turn-based\
● One player and one AI unit competes against each other\
● Winning condition: Reach a certain tile\
● The player and AI need to have access to two different ways of defining how many tiles
they will walk. One of them should be finite and rechargeable every X turns.

### Have some form of visual Map:
● Anything you want: grid-based, coordinates, navmesh, etc\
● 2D, 3D, or surprise us

### References:
● Main reference would be the board in Mario Party

### Example game:
● Grid based game (like mario party) with 2 different dice. One that goes 1-6 and you can
use how many times you want, one that goes 5-10 and can only be used once every 3
turns.

## Deliverables:
● Deliver the code either in github (user: mfstarloop) or a link to google drive.\
● Deliver a windows build in a google drive link
